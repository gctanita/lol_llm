# What do I want to do?

I am an avid League of Legends player. I have been playing the game since 2010, so, yeaah. Not competitive, and in the last 5 years or more, it's been mainly ARAM only. 

One of the frustrations that I have, as a player, is that there are a lot of variables to take into account when buying items. There are constant changes to the champions, constant changes to the items, each match is different, as there are diffrent champions in your team and in the enemy team. No matter how you look at it, it's always different. 

As I was thinking about how I could test an LLM, as I am a QA, I was also thinking back on almost 15 years of experience, and how I have managed to hone a deep understanding of the systems that I test, and the way they work. Then a curiosity struck me: could I build an LLM that could suggest while playing, what items to build? I have chatGpt to help me out, I have theoretical knowledge on LLMs and how they work. 

Sounds like an interesting challenge :D (Famous last words probably... but hey... It's worth giving it a shot...)
