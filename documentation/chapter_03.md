# Focusing

Ok, so after collecting the data, and playing around a bit with it, I ended up with the conclusion that instead of all the calls i've been maiking i actually need 2: to get the user matches and to get the match info.

So I will modify the collection script to do this, while introducing a new status for the tracking of the data scrapers. 

After that I will try to create some visualisations in Jupyter Notebook, to see how the data collected correlates.
